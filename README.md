# MTC-CSNet
This repository is the `PyTtorch` code for our paper `"MTC-CSNet: Marrying Transformer and Convolution for Image Compressed Sensing"`.  
## 1. Introduction ##
**1) Datasets**  

Training set: [`BSDS500`](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html) and [`VOC2012`](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/), validation set: [`Set11`](https://github.com/KuldeepKulkarni/ReconNet), testing sets: [`Set5`](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Aline.Roumy/results/SR_BMVC12.html), [`Set14`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eugenesiow/Set14), [`CBSD68`](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/) and [`Manga109`](http://www.manga109.org/en/).

**3) Performance demonstrates**  

**I.** Visual comparisons under `Gaussian noise` with variance `σ = 0.02` in the case of dataset `CBSD68`, `τ ∈ {0.01, 0.04, 0.10, 0.25}`. The results of PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS are given below the reconstructed images:

**II.** PSNR and LPIPS comparisons under `Gaussian noise` with variance `σ ∈ {0.01, 0.05}` in the case of dataset `Manga109` at `τ = 0.01`.

## 2. Useage ##  
**1) For training MTC-CSNet.**  

* Put the `BSDS500 (.jpg)` and `VOC2012 (.jpg)` into `./dataset/train/`.  
* e.g. If you want to train MTC-CSNet at sampling rate τ = 0.1 with GPU No.0, please run the following command. The train set will be automatically packaged and our MTC-CSNet will be trained with default parameters (Make sure you have enough GPU RAM):  
```
python train.py --device 0 --rate 0.1
```
* Also you can also run our shell script directly, it will automatically train the model at all sampling rates:  
```
sh train.sh
```
* Your trained models (.pth) will save in the `models` folder, it should contain `info.pth`, `model.pth`, `optimizer.pth` and `log.txt`, respectively represent the information during the training process, trained model parameters, optimizer information, and the reconstruction performance (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) of the verification set after one training epoch.  

**2) For testing MTC-CSNet.**  
* Put the `Set5 (.png)`, `Set14 (.png)`, `CBSD68 (.png)` and `Manga109 (.png)` folders into `./dataset/test/`.  
* For example, if you want to test MTC-CSNet at sampling rate τ = 0.1 with GPU No.0, please run:  
```
python test.py --device 0 --rate 0.1
```  
* For convenience of testing, this command will perform image sampling and reconstruction upon `all the test datasets` at `one sampling rate`. This is an example of the test results from the command line:  
```

Set5 test done.
```
* After that, the results of all tests will be saved to `./gene_images/`. `recon` folder includes all the reconstructed images, `sum.txt` shows the average results of the test set, `detail.txt` shows the Each result of the test set.
